# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Various ADR templates are available, including those by Michael Nygard, InnoQ, and other customized formats.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard, due to the following reasons:

* Simplicity and clarity: The template is concise and focuses on key decision-making aspects without unnecessary complexity.

* Industry adoption: Michael Nygardâ€™s format is widely used and well-documented, making it easier for new team members to understand.

* Standardization: Using a common format ensures consistency in documentation across projects.

* Integration with existing tools: The format works well with lightweight ADR toolsets such as adr-tools by Nat Pryce.

## Consequences

* Team members will need to follow the structured format to maintain consistency.

* Future revisions may require minor adjustments as the project evolves.
